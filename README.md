# InteriorLab

InteriorLab is a Python-based project that leverages OpenAI's GPT API to generate OpenSCAD code for 3D models of interior design elements. The generated code can be used in Tinkercad to create and visualize detailed 3D models.

## Features

- **Generate 3D Models**: Generate detailed OpenSCAD code for various interior design elements using natural language prompts.
- **Tinkercad Integration**: Use the generated OpenSCAD code in Tinkercad for creating and visualizing 3D models.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Interact with a chatbot to provide prompts and receive OpenSCAD code.
